# Intro

### Mission

**Create a metaverse made out of autonomous, zero maintenance, self sustainable web3 microservices made to last million+ years.**
The **Anvil protocol** defines the rules, syntax and semantics of communication.

Usually companies which build platforms/ games/ worlds take real profits, while banning users from doing so too.
We believe that crypto technologies will flip the script. Companies involved will take whatever terms users decide to give them.

The metaverse corporations of today will be decentralised and transform from giant monolithic dictatorship constructs, to small & healthy organisations.
Crypto makes that possible. Independent inventors, developers & creatives can get crowdfunded and can create small profitable and reusable protocols, services & components.
These protocols will be to games and worlds as HTTP, SMTP, FTP are to the web.

As it is unthinkable today to create a website that is not accessible through HTTP, in the future, it will be unthinkable to create a game/dapp, which will have items, achievements & tokens, without protocol like Anvil. A protocol built and owned by the community, that makes users masters of their inventories and liberates them to freely trade and move their digital property.

Moving items freely from one game/ world to another should be an article of human rights.

### Sought properties

- Autonomous
- Unstoppable
- Decentralized
- Permissionless
- Trustless
- Zero maintenance
- Crowdsourced
- Crowdfunded
- Censorship resistant

### Polylithic design

Our philosophy encourages polylithic design, because it results in small tools where each one does one thing well and can be combined in many ways. Thats how the UNIX community works. Eric Raymond summarizes these in part as:

#### Rule of Modularity

Developers should build a program out of simple parts connected by well defined interfaces, so problems are local, and parts of the program can be replaced in future versions to support new features. This rule aims to save time on debugging complex code that is complex, long, and unreadable.

#### Rule of Clarity

Developers should write programs as if the most important communication is to the developers, including him- or herself, whom will read and maintain the program rather than the computer. This rule aims to make code readable and comprehensible for whoever works on the code in future.

#### Rule of Composition

Developers should write programs that can communicate easily with other programs. This rule aims to allow developers to break down projects into small, simple programs rather than overly complex monolithic programs.

#### Rule of Separation

Developers should separate the mechanisms of the programs from the policies of the programs; one method is to divide a program into a front-end interface and back-end engine that interface communicates with. This rule aims to let policies be changed without destabilizing mechanisms and consequently reducing the number of bugs.

#### Rule of Simplicity

Developers should design for simplicity by looking for ways to break up program systems into small, straightforward cooperating pieces. This rule aims to discourage developers’ affection for writing “intricate and beautiful complexities” that are in reality bug prone programs.

### Microservices

Microservices - also known as the microservice architecture - is an architectural style that structures an application as a collection of services that are:

- Highly maintainable and testable
- Loosely coupled
- Independently deployable
- Organized around business capabilities
- Owned by a small team
- The microservice architecture enables the rapid, frequent and reliable delivery of large, complex applications. It also enables an organization to evolve its technology stack.

When we take the microservice architecture and:

- deploy it on a decentralized computer with smart contracts like the Internet Computer
- have a decentralized community DAO which governs its code or have it immutable

Than we end up with a decentralised backbone which makes the **Anvil protocol** work.

### Protocols

A communication protocol is a system of rules that allows two or more entities of a communications system to transmit information. The protocol defines the rules, syntax and semantics.

Internet has 7 layers of protocols. Some notable protocols: Bitcoin, Ethereum, HTTP, SMTP & ICP protocol work over TCP/IP protocol. TLS/SSL protocol is used alongside them.
**Anvil protocol works over ICP protocol.**

### UX/ UI design

As humans, we have an underlying “blueprint” for how we perceive and process the world around us, and the study of psychology helps us decipher this blueprint. Designers can use this knowledge to build more intuitive, human-centered products and experiences. Instead of forcing users to adapt to the design of a product or experience, we can use some key principles from psychology as a guide for designing in a way that is adapted to people.

Laws of UX is a collection of best practices that designers can consider when building user interfaces. https://lawsofux.com/
